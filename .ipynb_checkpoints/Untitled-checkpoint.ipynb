    "1.1.1 Overview\n",
    "SyriaTel is the leading communications company in the region and most customers are happy with its services.However,recently,they have been facing a spike in customer churn.As the lead data scientist tasked to analyze this trend and predict the churn rate,I understand that this task is crucial in helping Syriatel enhance customer retention,establish market dominance,foster customer obsession and improve their revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also true that it is effective to retain existing customers than to get new ones.Happy clients bring more clients and disgruntled ones lower the company's Net Promoter Score."

    "1.1.4 Proposed Solution\n",
    "The proposed solution is to develop a Predictive Churn Model that Identifies customers at high risk of churning using historical data , predictive analytics and Machine Learning and recommending ways to mitigate the churn.\n",
    "The ML techniques I will be using in this project are :\n",
    "\n",
    "Feature Engineering: This will help me analyze the variou features from my dataset that affect churn rates and use them to make a prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "ML Algorithm Selection: I will use classification algorithms such as logistic regression, decision trees, KNNs, and ensemble methodslike Random Forest, Gradient Boosting and any other model deemed necessary.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some of the Metrics for Prediction that I may use are:\n",
    "\n",
    "Accuracy: How spot on will this model be in predicting churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "Precision: How many customers that we identify as churners will actually churn?\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall: Out of the customers that truly churned,how many did we actually predict right?\n",
    "\n",
    "F1 Score: Balance between precision and recall, giving a single metric that balances both false poitives and false negatives.\n",
    "\n",
    "AUC-ROC Curve: How good the model is at distinguishing between churners and non churners.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confusion matrix : Compares churners and non churners and evaluates model based on the type of errors it is making;type I or type II\n",
    "\n",
    "By leveraging these techniques and metrics, we can develop a robust model to proactively address the challenges leading to customer churn and enhance SyriaTel's customer retention strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.1.5 Brief Conclusion\n",
    "Customer churn poses significant challenges for SyriaTel, impacting revenue and customer loyalty. By developing a predictive churn model using machine learning, we can identify at-risk customers and address factors like service quality, pricing, and customer service. Key stakeholders, including executive management and customer retention teams, will benefit from actionable insights to improve retention strategies. Our model will be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1 score, and AUC-ROC. This project aims to enhance SyriaTel’s competitive edge and foster a loyal customer base.\n",
    "\n",
    "1.2 PROBLEM STATEMENT\n",
    "At SyriaTel,the issue of customer churn has been an urgent matter that needs immediate intervention.We will perform Root Cause Analysis by using data driven approach and machine learning.Some of the potential challenges causing the massive spike in churn may be related to pricing,cutomer service experience,product quality among others.We will get to the bottomof it and provide insights that enable our client to maintain market dominance,foster customer obsession,enhance customer retention and improve their revenue.\n",
